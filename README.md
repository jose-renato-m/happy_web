## 📝 Description

Happy is an app based on the **Next Week Level 3 (NLW#3)** workshop featured by **Rocketseat School**,m which is a special week where we build a web app from zero. The aim of this app, inspired in the Children's Week, is to connect communities with **Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO's)** in order to give support to the entities that take care of children in need, as well as give love to these children.
